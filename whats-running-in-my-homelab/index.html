Over time, I’ve focused on self-hosting more and relying less on public services, gradually expanding my hardware and running more ambitious projects.</p><p>In this post, I’ll highlight the most-used services in my homelab. These are the ones my friends, family, and I rely on the most or find the most valuable, in no particular order. In future posts, I’ll cover my setup in more detail, from the foundation to the applications I use.</p><h3 id="1-nextcloud">1. Nextcloud</h3><p>This one is pretty obvious—<a href="https://github.com/nextcloud">Nextcloud</a> is the de facto standard self-hosted cloud platform for homelab owners. It offers a versatile solution for file storage, syncing, and sharing, along with a wide range of additional features. Its flexibility and strong community support make it an essential choice for anyone looking to take control of their data.</p><p>Nextcloud handles a lot for me: it serves as my default cloud file storage and sharing platform, acts as a backend for contacts and calendars, manages my project planning, functions as a collaborative to-do manager, includes a powerful office suite, it’s integrated with my favourite diagram drawing application, and features an excellent photo gallery. I also rely on it for instant messaging and videoconferencing, use it extensively for markdown notes (coupled with Obsidian), and even allow others to schedule appointments with me through it. All of this is easily accessible to me whether I’m at home, traveling, using someone else’s computer, or on my smartphone—you get the idea.</p><h3 id="2-vaultwarden">2. Vaultwarden</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden">Vaultwarden</a> is an unofficial Bitwarden server implementation written in Rust. It’s incredibly lightweight, resource-efficient, and simple to deploy.

Zipline</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/diced/zipline">Zipline</a> is a feature-packed image and file upload server built with Next.js and React. It is a self-hosted alternative for tools like imgur, wetransfer, bitly and pastebin.

It can be easily integrated with <a href="https://getsharex.com/">ShareX</a> and <a href="https://flameshot.org/">Flameshot</a> making screenshot management and sharing a breeze.</p><h3 id="4-home-assistant">4. Home Assistant</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/home-assistant">Home Assistant</a> is an open-source home automation platform that focuses on privacy and local control.

Firefly III</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii">Firefly III</a> is an open-source personal finance manager that helps you keep track of your expenses, incomes, and budgets. Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, it offers an intuitive interface for organizing your financial data and gaining insights into your spending habits.</p><p>What sets Firefly III apart is its self-hosted nature, giving you full control over your financial data. It also has a great API backend allowing integration with third-party applications (like Waterfly III or Abacus for Android) for on-the-go expense tracking.</p><h3 id="6-freepbx">6. FreePBX</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/FreePBX/sng_freepbx_debian_install">FreePBX</a> is a powerful, open-source PBX system that allows you to create a fully functional VoIP phone system for your home or business. Built on top of Asterisk, FreePBX provides a web-based interface to manage calls, extensions, voicemail, and other telephony features.</p><p>Besides connecting it to a SIP trunk for making and receiving calls, FreePBX also works well as an intercom system. For example you can connect it to a couple VoIP phones and place internal calls between floors or manage a SIP-enabled doorbell system.</p><h3 id="7-uptime-kuma">7. Uptime Kuma</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma">Uptime Kuma</a> is an open-source monitoring tool that helps you track the availability of your services. It provides a simple, user-friendly dashboard to monitor your servers, websites, and other endpoints.</p><p>With support for protocols like HTTP(s), TCP, and ICMP, Uptime Kuma allows you to easily set up monitoring checks and receive alerts if anything goes down.

My <strong>OpenLDAP</strong> stack handles authentication and access control.</p><p>For storage, my <strong>TrueNAS</strong> NAS stores and shares data with redundancy, ensuring it’s always accessible and backed up while <strong>Proxmox</strong> gives me the power to quickly spin up and manage virtual machines and containers, allowing me to test different configurations or run VulnHub VMs without needing additional physical hardware.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on Tuesday, 28 January 2025</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fe4ld3rs0n.github.io%2Fbughunter-publii%2Fwhats-running-in-my-homelab%2F" class="js-share invert facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://e4ld3rs0n.github.io/bughunter-publii/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fe4ld3rs0n.github.io%2Fbughunter-publii%2Fwhats-running-in-my-homelab%2F" class="js-share invert linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://e4ld3rs0n.github.io/bughunter-publii/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=What's%20running%20in%20my%20homelab%3F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fe4ld3rs0n.github.io%2Fbughunter-publii%2Fwhats-running-in-my-homelab%2F" class="js-share invert buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://e4ld3rs0n.github.io/bughunter-publii/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#buffer"/></svg> <span>Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=What's%20running%20in%20my%20homelab%3F https%3A%2F%2Fe4ld3rs0n.github.io%2Fbughunter-publii%2Fwhats-running-in-my-homelab%2F" class="js-share invert whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://e4ld3rs0n.github.io/bughunter-publii/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://e4ld3rs0n.github.io/bughunter-publii/moving-away-from-wordpress-2/" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Moving Away from WordPress "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">Moving Away from WordPress</span></a></div></nav></article><div class="post__comments"></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2023 - 2025 BugHunter</p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://e4ld3rs0n.github.io/bughunter-publii/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=c2232aa7558e9517946129d2a1b8c770"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'overlay',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
